/*
﻿// Question 3 - implementation
 // 
 //	without using STL containers implement the following:
 //	A class for a dynamic int array, let's call it "CVectorInt" that -
 //  1. doubles its size automatically when its full (allocates twice the size and moves the data),
 //	 2. halves its size when it is half empty (allocates half of the size and moves the data)
 //  3. can be told the initial capacity (num of ints) in a constructor
 //  4. have a method called "reserve" - that Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain n elements.
 //     If n is greater than the current vector capacity, the function causes the container to reallocate its storage increasing its capacity to n
 //  5. have a method called "capacity" - that returns the number of int elements allocated
 //  6. have a method called "size" - that returns the number of elements actually inserted
 //  7. have a method called "empty" - that returns true/false according to amount of actual elements in the data
 //  8. have a method called "clear" - that frees all the data and resets the size
 //  9. have a method called "push_back" - that adds an int elements at the end
 // 10. have a method called "pop_back" - that removes an int elements at the end and return it
 // 11. have a method called "remove"  - that removes an int elements at specific index
 // 12. have an interface to access the data at a specific index using subscript "[]"
 //
 // make sure to handle edge cases such as memory issues, size issues etc.
